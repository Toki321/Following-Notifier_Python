# Following-Notifier_Python

Every time a twitter account from the list of accounts follows someone that meets a certain criteria, notify in a telegram group.

This project was made for a good frend of mine, blockchain researcher that works for a fund. Helps him catch new blockchain protocols/projects early :)
